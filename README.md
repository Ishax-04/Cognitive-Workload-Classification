# Cognitive-Workload-Classification
Feature Extraction and Classification of Cognitive Mental workload | EEG signals | Machine Learning | Deep Learning.


Ipynb notebook file that contains a machine learning model to extract features from EEG signals and classify cognitive mental worload using dfferent algorithms.
Machine learning algorithms can be trained by the extracted features.

Steps:

Download the Cognitive-Mental-workload-EEG-Data, import.

Perform pre - processing on data and extract the features.

Run all the code in the notebook.

Use these normalized features to train differnt classifiers.
